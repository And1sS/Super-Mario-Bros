# Super Mario Bros

This is my attempt to recreate original Super Mario Bros game with Java and LibGdx. 
The game is in early development stage, and I'm not really sure if I can finish it myself. 
If, somehow, I will finish it, the game will be awailable on PC and Android. 
The project is completely opensource, feel free to download and tweak the code!)

For now, game looks like this:
